# Object-Oriented-Javascript
OOP explained in jscript example

Read this:


**************

EventTarget
	addEventListener: f add.........etc
	...etc
	...etc
	constructor: f EventTarget()
		     arguments: null
		     caller: null
			   length: 0
			   name: "EventTarget"
		prototype: EventTar.... etc
    
***************

this is from chrome inspector of a youtube video page. It is actually a node, because youtube is in drupal.

Whatever, see, that this is function Event Target()

A constructor is a version of a function (in this case of function Event Target() ), which accepts parameters, and passes those parameters to the original version of the function. Otherwise you cannot pass variables, or parametrize a function, you have to instantiate a version, which takes those parameters, and then it is somehow passed to the original function (of which the constructor is the version (dummy version), which takes the parameters, and passes them to the original function.

ok?

Now... you see, that the name of the contructor of Event Target() function, is f.

f is the name of the contructor (I'm not saying anything with this).

ok?

So...... f cannot take ANY parameters by defaults of the instantiation. Only one parameter is accepted, the string (which is the name) "EventTarget".

But... you also see, that any parameter length is set to zero BEFORE declaring a name parameter ("Event Target" in this example).

So, it is almost by default.... haha

can you make sense of this? This is object oriented programming logic :)



sleep well :) don't dream in code, dream in images :))))
